# Policy Lifecycle Analytical Model

## Purpose

The purpose of this model is to provide a structured, time-based view of the insurance policy lifecycle in order to analyse customer awareness, behaviour, and complaint risk across key stages.

Rather than analysing complaints in isolation, this model enables insights to be anchored to specific lifecycle moments where customer understanding, communication timing, and financial impact intersect.

## Defined Policy Lifecycle Stages

The policy lifecycle is segmented into the following analytical stages.

---

### 1. Pre-Renewal Period

**Definition:**  
The period leading up to the policy renewal date, during which customers are informed about upcoming renewal activity.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Advance communication is issued
- Customer attention may be low
- Renewal assumptions are often formed

**Analytical Risks:**
- Communication not noticed or understood
- Over-reliance on written notifications
- Misalignment between information delivery and customer engagement

---

### 2. Renewal Point

**Definition:**  
The point at which the policy renews and any automated payment is processed.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Financial transaction occurs
- Cover continuity is maintained
- Customer reaction may be delayed

**Analytical Risks:**
- Perceived lack of consent
- Surprise financial impact
- Misinterpretation of policy status

---

### 3. Cooling-Off Period

**Definition:**  
The regulated period following renewal during which customers can cancel the policy.

**Key Characteristics:**
- High customer contact volume
- Emotional response to renewal outcome
- Time-sensitive decisions

**Analytical Risks:**
- Complaints triggered by retrospective awareness
- Escalations driven by dissatisfaction rather than process failure
- Increased agent involvement

---

### 4. Post-Renewal Period

**Definition:**  
The period after the cooling-off window has closed.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Reduced customer flexibility
- Greater focus on resolution outcomes
- Potential trust erosion

**Analytical Risks:**
- Entrenched dissatisfaction
- Reduced resolution options
- Higher likelihood of formal complaint escalation

## Analytical Value of Lifecycle Segmentation

Segmenting complaints by lifecycle stage enables:
- Identification of high-risk timing windows
- Clear differentiation between awareness gaps and process failures
- Better assessment of preventability
- Targeted intervention strategies aligned to timing

This model forms the foundation for subsequent complaint analysis, insight generation, and decision-making within this project.
