# Auto-Renewal & Policy Lifecycle Insights Summary

## Purpose

This document presents key insights derived from timeline-based analysis of auto-renewal related complaints using the synthetic dataset included in this repository.

The analysis focuses on how customer awareness, communication timing, and financial impact interact across the policy lifecycle to drive complaints and escalation risk.

---

## Lifecycle Distribution of Complaints

Complaints cluster strongly around two lifecycle stages:
- The **Renewal Point**
- The **Cooling-Off Period**

These stages coincide with financial transactions and retrospective customer awareness, creating heightened sensitivity and dissatisfaction risk.

Pre-renewal complaints are less frequent but represent valuable early intervention opportunities.

---

## Insight 1: Complaints Peak Immediately After Renewal

A significant proportion of complaints occur within **0–3 days after renewal**, particularly during the cooling-off period.

Although renewal processes are compliant, customers often become aware of:
- Policy continuation
- Automated payments
- Policy terms

only after financial impact has occurred.

**Decision Implication:**  
Shift some customer understanding *before* renewal rather than relying on post-renewal explanations.

---

## Insight 2: Customer Awareness Is the Primary Driver, Not Process Failure

Most complaints are linked to customers being **not aware or only partially aware** of:
- Renewal timing
- Payment execution
- Active policy status

In many cases, communication was technically sent but not effectively received or understood.

**Decision Implication:**  
Success metrics should distinguish between *communication sent* and *customer understanding achieved*.

---

## Insight 3: Financial Surprise Drives Escalation Risk

Complaints involving unexpected payments show a much higher likelihood of escalation, even when resolution options exist.

Escalation appears to be driven more by perceived loss of control than by actual financial harm.

**Decision Implication:**  
Targeted pre-renewal messaging around payment timing could significantly reduce escalation volumes.

---

## Insight 4: Preventability Is Highest at Early Lifecycle Stages

Complaints occurring during:
- Pre-renewal
- Renewal point
- Early cooling-off period

show high preventability potential through:
- Clearer communication
- Earlier intervention
- Stronger agent guidance

Complaints raised later in the post-renewal stage are less preventable and more resolution-focused.

**Decision Implication:**  
Prevention efforts should be prioritised earlier in the lifecycle.

---

## Insight 5: Escalation Does Not Always Reflect Complaint Severity

Several escalated complaints show lower objective impact but higher emotional response, often driven by misunderstanding.

This suggests escalation thresholds may benefit from clearer guidance and stronger early ownership.

**Decision Implication:**  
Reducing unnecessary escalations may improve efficiency without reducing customer fairness.

---

## Cross-Cutting Themes

Across lifecycle stages, the following themes recur:
- Awareness gaps are more influential than compliance gaps
- Timing matters more than volume
- Prevention is most effective before financial impact
- Escalation is strongly perception-driven

---

## Value of Timeline-Based Analysis

Anchoring complaint analysis to the policy lifecycle enables:
- Clear identification of timing risk
- Fairer assessment of preventability
- More targeted operational interventions
- Better alignment between compliance and customer experience

This approach supports balanced, evidence-based decision-making in regulated environments.
